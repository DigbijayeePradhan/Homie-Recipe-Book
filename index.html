                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p>
                            <br>In a bowl, mix warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5–10 mins until frothy.
                            <br>Add flour, salt, and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms.
                            <br>Knead it on a floured surface for about 8–10 mins until smooth.
                            <br>Place it in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise for 1–2 hours (until doubled in size).
                            <br>Heat olive oil in a pan. Add garlic and sauté briefly.
                            <br>Add crushed tomatoes, salt, pepper, and herbs. Let it simmer for 10–15 minutes.
                            <br>Taste and adjust seasoning. Let it cool.
                            <br>Set your oven to the highest temperature, usually around 475–500°F (245–260°C).
                            <br>If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up.
                            <br>Once risen, punch down the dough and divide it (if making more than one pizza).
                            <br>Roll or stretch it into a circle or rectangle (depends on your vibe).
                            <br>Place it on parchment paper or a baking sheet.

                            <br>Add your favorite toppings (less is more if you want it to cook evenly).
                            <br>Transfer the pizza to the oven (stone or baking sheet).
                            <br>Bake for 10–15 mins or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling.
                            <br>Let the pizza cool slightly, then slice it up and enjoy
                            Maybe finish with a drizzle of olive oil or some fresh basil if you're feeling fancy.
